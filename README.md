A travel planning experience designed for places where the internet disappears.

✨ What is TrailSync?

TrailSync is a frontend-focused Progressive Web App (PWA) built for travelers, trekkers, and explorers who often find themselves in remote or low-network areas.

Most travel apps break when the internet is gone.
TrailSync is built around a simple idea:

Your plans, routes, and notes should still work — even when you’re offline.

This project focuses on clean UI, offline usability, and real-world travel problems, making it ideal as a portfolio and internship showcase project.
