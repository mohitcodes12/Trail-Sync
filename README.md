🌍 TrailSync — Offline-First Smart Travel & Trek Planner

TrailSync is a modern, frontend-focused Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for travelers, trekkers, and explorers who often face low or no internet connectivity.

Unlike traditional travel apps, TrailSync focuses on offline usability, route awareness, and trip organization, making it ideal for treks, remote locations, and adventure travel.

🚀 Built as a portfolio-ready project with clean UI, scalable architecture, and PWA capabilities.
